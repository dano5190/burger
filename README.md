# burger

This is the Burger App.  It uses mySQL, Express, and Express-Handlebars to create a webpage that creates burgers and stores them in a database.  On the User side, there is a button next to each burger labeled "Devour It!" that will change the location of the burger on the webpage and will alter the burger in the database.  The User can create as many burgers as they want simply by entering a name and then pressing the "Order Up!" button, at which point that burger will be added to the "Ready Burgers!" column, and added to the database itself.

The server is launched by typing "node server.js" into the terminal.

The npm packages required are:

npm install express
npm install express-handlebars
npm install mysql

The PORT number to run with the localhost is 8080, and the url is "localhost:8080" after "node server.js" is entered into the terminal.
